\section{Introduction}
\justify
In this laboratory assignment we will be taking a look at \omp parallelization of the \sieve algorithm.
The program computes the prime numbers in an interval from 2 to a given treshold. 

\justify
Firt of all we will look at two common \omp parallelization schemes, a task based model, and a worksharing constructs model, and then, compare its performance.
