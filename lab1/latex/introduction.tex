In this laboratory assignment we will be taking a look at \omp parallelization of the \sieve algorithm.
 
 \justify
The \sieve computes prime numbers in an interval from $[2,n]$ where $n\in \mathbb{N} \wedge n > 2$ based on the fact that multiples of prime numbers aren't prime numbers, it iterates through the possible primes and if they are marked as primes we discard its multiples.

We are given a sequential version of the program from which we will implement different parallel versions.
