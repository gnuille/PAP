\section{Parallelization strategies}
In this section we are going to implement two diferent parallel versions of the \sieve algorithm.

\subsection{Worksharing constructs model}
Taking into account 

\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp paralllel for
\end{lstlisting}

Later on, we wil analyze the performance, and modify the pragma to try different granularities.

\subsection{Task based model}
